# Simple Upsell Bump

Simple app that adds a configurable upsell bump in the storefront checkout flow to help merchants offer a complimentary product and increase AOV. 


> This app is an example and is meant to be a starting point for developers to fork and add their own custom logic multiple differen't upsell offer trigger options or any additional business logic necessary for a merchant's unqiue requirements. 


### How It Works

Once installed, the app allows a merchant to configure a product in the cart to trigger showing an upsell offer for another product. A coupon can also be added as part of the upsell offer to make it more enticing for customers to add the additional product to their cart. 


App settings use the built in [App Form](https://developers.29next.com/docs/apps/manifest/) from manifest.json allowing easy configuration through the dashboard.
